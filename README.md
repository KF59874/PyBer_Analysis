# PyBer_Analysis

create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


# 1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
The data from a ride-sharing company has been analysed to determine what how ride-sharing companies perform depending on the type of city they are operating in. The different city types included: urban, suburban and rural cities.

# 2. Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. 
Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

Data from three different city types has been analysed to determine how ride-sharing companies perform depending on whether a city is urban, suburban or rural. The following attributes have been looked at to determine the differences: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 

The following table summarizes the data from urban, suburban and rural cities:

The total rides were 13 times and 5 times more common in urban and suburban cities, respectfully, than in rural cities. Urban cities had a total of 1625 rides, suburban a total of 625 rides, and rural areas a total of 125 rides.  

There were significantly less drivers in rural areas than in urban and suburban areas, with urban cities having over 30 times (total of 2405 drivers), and suburban cities having 6 times (total of 490 drivers) as many drivers than in rural areas (total of 78 drivers). 

Urban cities collectively had a larger revenue in total fares than suburban and rural areas. The total sum in fares per city type was: $39,854.38 in urban cities, $19,356.33 in suburban cities, and $4,327.93 in rural areas. 

The average fare price per ride was higher in rural areas by over $10.09 than in urban cities, and $3.65 more expensive than in suburban cities. The average fare per ride was $24.53 in urban cities, $30.97 in suburban cities, and $34.62 in rural areas. 

Drivers were paid higher per average fare in rural areas than in urban and suburban cities. Rural drivers received $55.49 per average fare, $39.50 per average fare in suburban cities, and $16.57 per average fare in urban cities.

The cities were furthermore also analysed based on the time of year. The graph below shows a snapshot of the data from January 2019 to the end of April of 2019.

# 3. Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
